BUG
---
* Zoom out / move after drawing curve, first line-segment is disappeared
    - draw issue?? or add issue???
* We can move active region out of current sheet => crash!!
    - touch at minimap.
    - drag to out of area - usually upper
    - crash!!


Performance Optimization
------------------------
+ Draw Routibne
    => improve d2d line_draw routine.
    => use memory pool for 'lines_draw'
        : Memory pool for node (nmp_xxx) is not used.
          Way of nmp can be applied to 'lines_draw'

+ SMP optimization
    => Find lines to draw

Space Optimization
------------------
+ Optimization for memory usage.
    => anyway to improve??

Exception Handling
------------------
+ Handling OOM(Out Of Memory) : every where!
+ File interface (ex. Load/Save)

Refactoring
-----------
+ Split Java code into two part
    Platform(Android / PC Java platform) dependency.
    Platform independent.

+ SMP Optimization
    This should be done based on current host system at runtime.
    (At this version, done at compile time with configuration)

+ Code beautify for SMP optimization.
    Code is not well-structured for SMP optimization.
    Makeing simple framework to use SMP optimzation may be needed??

Features
--------
+ Java program to run 'writer' on JRE.
+ Networking(Share board(wsheet) between users.)
    Two options
        : Centralized Server
                    C1
                    |
             C2-----S-----C3
        : Network(With my first look, this is better...)
                     C1
                   //  \\
                  C2====C3
