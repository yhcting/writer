Memory
------
+ Optimization for memory usage.
+ Handling OOM(Out Of Memory)


Refactoring
-----------
+ SMP Optimization
    This should be done based on current host system at runtime.
    (At this version, done at compile time with configuration)

+ Code beautify for SMP optimization.
    Code is not well-structured for SMP optimization.
    Makeing simple framework to use SMP optimzation may be needed??
